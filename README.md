# Problem
As a burgeoning YouTuber with a substantial following, the challenge lies in efficiently harnessing the potential of spontaneous ideas observed in the surroundings. Currently, the go-to platform for quick note-taking is WhatsApp due to its accessibility. However, a crucial problem emerges: the subsequent process of transforming these raw ideas into well-structured content involves multiple platforms like Notion, OPEN AI, and Google.

The inefficiency arises from the disjointed nature of this workflow. After capturing a simple idea on WhatsApp, there is a need for seamless integration with Notion, a widely-used note-taking app, to organize and structure the concept. Simultaneously, the desire to leverage the capabilities of OPEN AI's ChatGPT and Google for refining and researching the idea poses a logistical challenge.


# Solution

let me get straight into this where you just put you raw and simple idea or statement into whatsApp (lets assume you made a Group of yourself for quick note) and what if you could have notion page filled with research links which you can utilize for your video
this project is heavely inspired by the idea of HARKIRAT's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdZzrLMeuzs&t=1047s
